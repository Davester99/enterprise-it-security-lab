# Enterprise IT Security Lab

This project simulates a small enterprise IT environment using Windows Server, Windows 10 clients, and a Kali Linux attacker machine.  
The goal is to demonstrate core IT administration skills (Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy), along with security monitoring and detection.

## Tools Used
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller, DNS, DHCP)
- Windows 10 (clients joined to the domain)
- Kali Linux (attack simulation)
- Sysmon (logging)
- Wazuh (SIEM monitoring)

## Lab Goals
1. Deploy a Windows domain with Active Directory and Group Policy.
2. Enforce security policies (password complexity, account lockouts, least privilege).
3. Set up log monitoring and event forwarding.
4. Simulate attacks and detect them in SIEM.

## Repository Structure
- `Project_Documentation/` → Setup guides, security configs, monitoring results  
- `Screenshots/` → Screenshots of lab environment and results  
- `Resume_Bullet_Points.md` → Ready-to-use resume lines
